# TicTacToe-Game
Java implementation of Tic Tac Toe game. Used JavaFX and Maven dependencies for the GUI.

IntermediateAI was implemented with Alpha-Beta pruning with a specified depth of 12.
GeeksForGeeks does a great job explaining Alpha-Beta pruning: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-4-alpha-beta-pruning/

# Java Views
There are multiple views in which you can switch between a Button layout and a Text area view.
